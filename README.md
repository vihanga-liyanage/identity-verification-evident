# Identity Verification with Evident

Identity Verification has been a popular concept for over a decade now, and when simply put, it's about verifying 
the identity of an online user. In other words, figuring out whether the person submitting the information is 
actually who they claim to be or not. There are many companies in the world that offer identity verification as a 
service, and most businesses tend to use these services, considering the level of expertise they've built upon the 
subject over time.

[Evident](https://www.evidentid.com) is a leading and award-winning Identity Verification provider in the industry 
that provides over 12,000 verifiable data types along with ID scans that cover over 195 countries. In this document, 
we're connecting WSO2 Identity Server with Evident for external identity verification that allows you to verify 
your users.

Please refer [IDV with Evident - Configuration Guidelines](docs/README.md) for more information.
